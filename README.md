# Complex-Analysis-Integration
Sometimes getting the integral of something in the complex plane can be unintuitive, and the answer can be unclear.  I used this code when unsure of my answer when I was in complex analysis, however this code is limited to contours which are easy to parametrize. Might work on a more general code later on to refresh myself on complex integration.
